# Dogfooding harness specification - Stages 2 through 6

These are the `dogfood-*` contracts the harness under `tests/dogfooding/`
satisfies. They are contracts on the TEST HARNESS, not on Bear, so they
intentionally live here and NOT under `docs/requirements/` (which is reserved
for Bear's own contracts). They are condensed from the staged plan; the plan is
the source of intent, this file is the implemented spec.

Scope: non-automated, run by the maintainer at release time. Bear's installed
release binaries are run against a real project inside a throwaway container,
and the captured compilation database is validated. Sources and toolchain live
only in the container, never in the repo or the devcontainer image
(feasibility.md Option C). A per-target `VALIDATION` selector in `config.env`
chooses the per-target validation mode: `golden` (Stage 2, zlib) gates against a
committed golden; `oracle` (Stage 3, curl) gates against the database CMake
itself emits. Three target-agnostic Stage 4 checks are selected by flag and need no
maintained baseline: `--determinism` (run the same target twice and compare the
two captures), `--invariants` (assert structural invariants on one capture), and
`--replay[=N]` (replay a sample of entries in their recorded directories). Each
builds+captures once (twice for determinism) and skips the golden/oracle gate.

## dogfood-run-containerized

The suite builds a real project inside a throwaway container using the
installed, release Bear binaries, leaving the repo working tree and the
devcontainer image unmodified. A release/install build is required (not a debug
tree) so `libexec.so` sits at the path the binary resolves via
`INTERCEPT_LIBDIR`; a mismatch makes Bear run but capture nothing, so the
harness verifies interception actually occurred (non-empty capture) before
trusting a run.

Implementation: Bear is built inside the base image from `git archive HEAD`
(committed files only) and installed with `scripts/install.sh` to `PREFIX=/opt/bear`
(default `INTERCEPT_LIBDIR=lib`), giving the layout
`/opt/bear/bin/bear` -> `/opt/bear/libexec/bear/bin/bear-driver` +
`../lib/libexec.so`. The base carries no Rust toolchain (multi-stage build).

## dogfood-fixed-paths

The build runs at fixed, well-known container paths so absolute paths in
`directory` (and in arguments) do not vary between runs, making command lines
reproducible and letting the golden check pass with little or no normalization.

Implementation: zlib builds in-tree at the fixed path `/src` (its `./configure`
has no usable out-of-tree mode). The config pins `SRC_DIR=/src`.

## dogfood-pinned-target

A dogfooding configuration is (base image digest, target source revision,
target build type); all are pinned so the golden stays stable. An unpinned base
would let a package update change the compiler under a fixed golden; an unpinned
build type would change the recorded flags. Release is the default build type.

Implementation: `targets/zlib/config.env` pins the fedora:44 base by digest, the
zlib 1.3.1 tarball by URL + sha256, and `BUILD_TYPE=Release`
(`CFLAGS="-O3 -DNDEBUG"`).

## dogfood-golden-regression

For the pinned target, the suite compares Bear's output against a tracked golden
using `cdb-compare compare` (order-independent multiset equivalence) and flags
any change. The golden is a frozen, full normalized compilation database emitted
with `cdb-compare normalize --sort`, committed under `tests/dogfooding/goldens/`
(NOT under the git-ignored `results/`). The Stage 1 binary is reused as-is; no
hash-manifest tooling is added. The golden is a change-detector, not an
independent proof of correctness.

Implementation: `goldens/zlib/compile_commands.json` is the frozen golden; the
gate is `cdb-compare compare <golden> <fresh>` run on the host. No normalization
flags are used (same pinned image + fixed `/src` => raw multiset matches); if a
benign compiler-path diff ever appears, add `--substitute-compiler cc` to both
the bless and the check, consistently.

## dogfood-golden-rebless

There is a documented, deliberate procedure to regenerate the golden when a
behavior change is intentional, so re-blessing is explicit and reviewable rather
than automatic.

Implementation: `run.sh --rebless <target>` runs the full pipeline, then writes
`cdb-compare normalize --sort <fresh>` to the golden path instead of gating, and
reports "reblessed" for the maintainer to review and commit. See README.md.

## dogfood-preflight

Before launching any container, the suite verifies free disk against a
per-target minimum, that the pinned image digest is present/pullable, and that
the image carries a working Bear (the non-empty-capture check). It exits
non-zero with a clear diagnostic on any failure, so a run never starts only to
leave a torn scratch behind.

Implementation: `run.sh` step 1 checks free disk on the podman graphroot
(`podman info` + `df -Pk`) against `MIN_FREE_KIB` and resolves/pulls the pinned
digest; step 4 runs a trivial `bear -- gcc -c` and asserts the capture is
non-empty before the real build.

## dogfood-build-failure-taxonomy

The harness distinguishes a target build failure (network, source fetch, OOM,
missing target dep, configure/make error) from a Bear/harness failure, and
reports them as distinct outcomes. A target build that fails for its own reasons
is "inconclusive", not a Bear regression.

Implementation: four outcomes with distinct exit codes -
`PASS=0`, `FAIL=1` (golden regression, or oracle matched-TU divergence),
`INCONCLUSIVE=2` (target build failed for its own reasons: target image build,
configure/make), `ERROR=3` (harness or Bear-infra: podman missing, disk/digest
preflight, base build, empty capture, an oracle that matched 0 TUs, missing host
`cdb-compare`). `run.sh` prints one final `OUTCOME:` status line.

## dogfood-oracle-cmake (Stage 3)

For a CMake-native target, the suite compares Bear's output against the database
CMake itself emits (`CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`), scoped to the
intersection of translation units matched by `file`. The check passes when
matched TUs have equivalent flags under normalization. Entries present in only
one database are logged as "extras", never failures: CMake lists configured TUs
with configure-time flags, while Bear records the actual make-time command, so
a whole-database equality would be pure noise. The oracle renews itself when the
target updates; no hand-maintained baseline. The oracle target is curl (CMake-
native, small); zlib stays the Stage 2 golden target (autotools).

Implementation: `targets/curl/config.env` sets `VALIDATION=oracle` and pins the
fedora:44 base by digest, curl 8.11.1 by URL + sha256, and `BUILD_TYPE=Release`.
The in-container command (dogfood-fixed-paths) configures out-of-tree (source
`/src`, build `/build`) with `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON` and the
optional dependencies turned off (no TLS/nghttp2/zlib/zstd/brotli/psl/idn/ssh/
ldap), so curl builds with just cmake+gcc+make. The CMake *configure* step is
NOT wrapped by Bear (it is not a compile); only `cmake --build` is, so Bear's
capture lands at `/out/compile_commands.json` and CMake's reference database is
copied to `/out/oracle.json`. Both are pulled out with `podman cp`.

The comparison is done entirely by the host `cdb-compare` - no jq, no allow-list
file. Three normalizations plus a gating flag make it correct:
`--output-from-o` rewrites each `output` to the absolute object path derived
from the entry's `-o` argument joined with its `directory`, so TUs match by
source file plus the object they produce. That key is identical across producers
even though Bear encodes `output` relative to `directory` and CMake relative to
the build root, and a source compiled into several targets (shared lib, tool)
stays distinct rather than collapsing onto one key. `--drop-dependency-flags`
removes the `-M*` depfile group. `--substitute-compiler cc` absorbs any
compiler-driver path difference. `--intersection` then gates on the `differing`
set alone, reporting `only_in_a`/`only_in_b` as advisory extras. Exit 0 = matched
TUs equivalent (PASS); exit 1 = a real matched-TU divergence (FAIL). The harness
also refuses a vacuous comparison: if 0 TUs matched, the run is an ERROR, not a
silent pass.

## dogfood-divergence-report (Stage 3)

The Bear-only and CMake-only "extras" are reported for review, never a failure.
The one known-benign argument difference on matched TUs - the dependency-file
generation flags (`-MD`/`-MMD`/`-MP` and the argument-consuming
`-MF`/`-MT`/`-MQ`/`-MJ`) - is removed by `cdb-compare --drop-dependency-flags`
before the gate. These flags only control the build system's `.d` side-file,
never the object or how a Clang tool parses the TU, so dropping them is a tested,
documented operation of the comparator rather than a hand-maintained shell
allow-list. On the pinned curl build this group is the ENTIRE matched-but-
differing set (221/221 TUs); with it dropped, `differing` is empty and the gate
passes. `run.sh` writes the comparator's full report (its extras lists plus a
`summary:` line) to `results/<target>/<label>/oracle-report.txt`, with a
machine-readable `oracle-compare.json` alongside. There is no rebless for oracle
targets - the oracle is self-renewing, so `--rebless` is rejected for them.

If a future oracle target exhibits a different benign argument difference that
`--drop-dependency-flags` does not cover, extend the comparator with a tested
rule rather than reintroducing a shell allow-list - the comparison logic stays
in one unit-tested place.

## dogfood-determinism (Stage 4)

The suite can run the same target twice and assert Bear's two outputs are
equivalent under `dogfood-cdb-compare`. Any difference indicates non-determinism
or a race in Bear itself; the build is its own reference, no golden and no oracle
required. This is target-agnostic: it runs for any target, golden or oracle.

Implementation: `run.sh --determinism <target>` runs the shared preflight, base
+ target image builds, and the non-empty-capture smoke (exactly as a normal
run), then runs the target build TWICE in two distinct fresh throwaway
containers off the same pinned image (`build_and_capture` in `lib.sh`, invoked
once per container - the same body the normal single-run path uses, so the
build-failure taxonomy is identical), and compares the two captures with
`cdb-compare compare <run1> <run2>`. NO normalization flags are used: the fixed
build paths (`/src`, `/build`) make the two captures multiset-equivalent at the
source, and `cdb-compare` is order-independent, so build parallelism does not
matter. The golden/oracle gate is SKIPPED entirely (determinism is its own
check). `--determinism` with `--rebless` is rejected (ERROR: no golden is
involved); `--inject-fault` outside `--determinism` is likewise an ERROR.

Outcome (reusing the existing taxonomy): both captures equivalent => PASS;
captures differ => FAIL (real Bear non-determinism / a race), with the
`cdb-compare compare` diff saved to `results/<target>/<label>/determinism-diff.txt`
(and `.json`); either build failing for its own reasons => INCONCLUSIVE;
podman/infra/empty-capture/missing host `cdb-compare` => ERROR. Both captures
are written as `compile_commands.run1.json` and `compile_commands.run2.json`.

Self-test (the Stage 4 exit criterion - the check must demonstrably catch a
fault): `run.sh --determinism --inject-fault <target>` perturbs the SECOND build
with an extra compiler flag so the two builds legitimately diverge, and the
check is shown to FAIL. The fault is injected as a real, different second build,
NOT by editing captured JSON by hand: `run.sh` passes a non-empty `INJECT_CFLAGS`
(an extra `-D...` macro) into the second container only, and each target's
`config.env` threads `${INJECT_CFLAGS:-}` into that build's compiler flags
(`CFLAGS` for zlib's configure, `CMAKE_C_FLAGS` for curl's cmake). On a normal
run and on determinism run 1 the value is empty, a no-op. `run.sh --determinism
<target>` (no fault) PASSes; the `--inject-fault` variant FAILs. Both directions
are verified for zlib and curl.

Scope boundary: the DROPPED, DUPLICATED, and CORRUPTED-ENTRY faults from the
Stage 4 plan are NOT determinism's territory - they belong to
`dogfood-invariants` (dropped/duplicated/empty-arguments) and `dogfood-replay`
(corrupted `directory`), both specified below. Determinism's own fault model is
a divergent second build, which is exactly what `--inject-fault` exercises.

## dogfood-invariants (Stage 4)

For any target, the suite asserts structural invariants on Bear's single
capture: every entry has non-empty `arguments`, there are no TRUE duplicates
(identical `file` + `output` + normalized `arguments` - a source compiled into
different outputs with different flags is legitimate, not a duplicate), and the
entry count is within a configured tolerance of the number of object files the
build produced. Each invariant is independently reported. No golden, no oracle,
no maintained baseline.

Implementation: `run.sh --invariants <target>` runs the shared preflight, image
builds, and smoke, builds+captures once (`build_and_capture`), then gates on the
exit code of one host `cdb-compare invariants --drop-dependency-flags
--expected-objects <N> --tolerance <PCT> --format human <capture>`. The whole
structural check - non-empty-arguments, no-true-duplicates, and the entry-count
band - lives in the unit-tested comparator; the harness only supplies `<N>` and
`<PCT>` and gates the exit code (no JSON parsed in shell). Exit 0 => PASS;
exit 1 => FAIL (Bear produced a malformed CDB); a non-1 error or a build/infra
failure maps to ERROR/INCONCLUSIVE via `build_and_capture`. The human report is
saved to `results/<target>/<label>/invariants-report.txt`.

The object count `<N>` is taken IN the container before teardown, by a
per-target `OBJECT_COUNT_CMD` (config.env) written to `/out/object_count` and
pulled out. The instrument is per-target because "objects produced" is not
always "*.o files still on disk":
- curl / ffmpeg leave every object on disk, so the default
  `find $OBJECTS_DIR -name '*.o' | wc -l` is exact;
- zlib's in-tree `make` compiles each source twice (static + PIC) and DELETES
  the PIC objects at link time (19 survive, 34 produced), so it counts make's
  OWN dependency graph (`make -Bn`);
- the kernel aggregates objects into built-in.a / linked .o (a `find`
  overcounts) AND a `make -Bn` dry-run does not enumerate its recursive compiles
  (it counts ~0), so it counts Kbuild's per-compile `.foo.o.cmd` files instead.
All are build-system-native, cleanup-independent, Bear-independent. `<PCT>` is
the per-target `OBJECT_TOLERANCE_PCT`.

Graceful degradation: the entry-count cross-check is opt-in and must never block
the always-on structural checks. If `OBJECT_COUNT_CMD` cannot produce a number
(0 / empty), `run.sh` warns and runs `cdb-compare invariants` WITHOUT
`--expected-objects` (entry-count skipped), still gating on non-empty-arguments
and no-true-duplicates. A target whose independent object count is genuinely
hard still gets the structural invariants.

Scale: validated on two larger gate-less (`VALIDATION=none`) targets - ffmpeg
(~1945 TUs, exact: entries == objects == 1945) and the Linux kernel (x86_64
defconfig, ~3000 TUs: Kbuild `.cmd` count 2991 vs entries 3004, a 0.4% match).
The entry-count band is thus a real coverage cross-check at scale (did Bear
capture ~every compile?), not just a small-target nicety; entries == objects
exactly on zlib (34) and curl (221).

## dogfood-replay (Stage 4)

The suite takes a sample of Bear's entries and replays each recorded command in
its recorded `directory` with `-fsyntax-only` appended, asserting the compiler
accepts the recorded arguments. A command that fails to replay indicates a
malformed entry (wrong cwd, missing or mangled flag). Sampling size is
configurable. In a throwaway container a generated header may no longer exist,
so a replay failure for a TU that depends on a missing input is *inconclusive*,
not a Bear failure; the sampler preferentially selects TUs whose flags do not
reference build-dir includes to keep replay meaningful.

Implementation: `run.sh --replay[=N] <target>` (default N=20; also `--replay N`)
runs the shared pipeline, builds+captures once, and replays INSIDE the build
container as part of the same `podman run` - the recorded sources and generated
headers exist there only before teardown. The replay loop is one POSIX function
(`replay-loop.sh`) read into the in-container script; the in-image
`/opt/bear/bin/cdb-compare sample <capture> --count N --build-dir <BUILD_DIR>`
selects up to N replayable entries (build-dir-aware) and emits one shell-quoted
replay line per entry (`directory` then argv). Each is replayed as
`( cd "$dir" && "$@" -fsyntax-only )` and tallied: OK (compiler accepted the
args), INCONCLUSIVE (the failure stderr matches a missing-file diagnostic - "No
such file" / "file not found" / "not found" - a build-time input gone after
teardown), or FAIL (any other failure, including a `directory` that does not
exist - a corrupted-directory fault, caught before the compile by a `-d` test).
The function writes its tally and any failing commands to `/out/replay_result`
and its return code to `/out/replay_rc`, both pulled out and gated on without
parsing JSON. `BUILD_DIR` comes from config.env (curl `/build`; zlib has no
out-of-tree dir, so its `BUILD_DIR` is `/src`).

Gate (non-vacuity, mirroring the oracle): any real FAIL => FAIL (a malformed
entry); all OK with inconclusive allowed => PASS; EVERY sampled entry
inconclusive (nothing actually verified) => INCONCLUSIVE (replay must not pass
vacuously). On the pinned builds all 20 sampled entries replay OK for both zlib
and curl (0 FAIL, 0 INCONCLUSIVE).

## dogfood-clang-consumer (Stage 6)

The one real deliverable of the slimmed Stage 6. Feed a sample of the captured
database to a REAL clang-tooling consumer over the recorded entries, IN-container,
and assert the tool accepts each. This is the only check that validates the
database WORKS in the tool it exists for - catching a structurally-valid but
semantically-broken DB (a wrong/missing `-I`, a dropped `-x`, a missing sysroot)
that the structural invariants and the replay check both miss. Same shape as
dogfood-replay: reuse `cdb-compare sample`, categorize OK / FAIL / INCONCLUSIVE,
non-vacuous (an all-inconclusive or empty sample is INCONCLUSIVE, never a vacuous
PASS).

Implementation: `run.sh --consumer[=N] <target>` (default N=20; also `--consumer
N`) runs the shared pipeline, builds+captures once, and runs the consumer INSIDE
the build container as part of the same `podman run` - the recorded sources and
generated headers exist there only before teardown, AND the clang tooling lives
in the image (the host has no clang). The consumer loop is one POSIX function
(`consumer-loop.sh`) read into the in-container script, mirroring how
`replay-loop.sh` is wired. It is additive/standalone like `--replay`: mutually
exclusive with the other check modes, allowed on `VALIDATION=none` targets, and
gated on an in-container return code mapped to PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE/ERROR.

The consumer (chosen empirically, not guessed - the targets build with GCC, so
clang tooling must consume a gcc-built database) is:

```sh
clang-tidy --checks='-*,bugprone-assert-side-effect' --allow-no-checks \
    -p <cdb-dir> <file>
```

clang-tidy reads the gcc-recorded command from the CDB at `-p <cdb-dir>` and
mangles the driver-incompatible flags itself (dropping GCC-only flags clang does
not know) - that cross-compiler consumption is precisely what the check
validates. A single real check forces a full front-end parse (with NO check
enabled clang-tidy short-circuits and never parses, so the gate would be
vacuous); `--allow-no-checks` keeps the run from erroring should that check name
disappear from a future clang-tools. `clangd --check` was rejected as the
consumer: it runs clangd's INTERNAL tweak/refactoring self-tests over the TU and
reports their failures as "N errors" with a non-zero exit even when the AST built
perfectly (every curl TU "built the AST" yet reported up to 60 such bogus
errors), making its exit code useless as a database-validity signal. clang-tidy
with no lint check does a pure parse, so the only `error:` diagnostics are
genuine front-end errors.

Categorization (keyed on clang-tidy's `error:` diagnostics):
- **OK** - zero `error:` diagnostics: clang-tidy parsed the TU and built the AST
  from Bear's recorded command. Warnings are expected on a gcc TU under clang and
  are NOT a defect.
- **FAIL** - one or more `error:` diagnostics, INCLUDING a not-found `#include`.
  This relies on the loop's premise: the consumer runs in the LIVE post-build
  container, so every header the build saw (source-tree AND generated) is still
  on disk. A "file not found" therefore is NOT a generated-header-gone artifact
  (that only happens after teardown); it means Bear's recorded include paths do
  not let the tool find a header the build found - the wrong/missing-`-I` defect
  the check exists for.
- **INCONCLUSIVE** - the TU source itself is no longer on disk (the one genuine
  missing-input case, since a TU source, unlike a header, can be a generated
  file). Kept narrow so the not-found-header FAIL signal is not diluted.

Gate (mirroring the oracle / replay non-vacuity): any FAIL => FAIL; all OK
(inconclusive allowed) => PASS; EVERY sampled entry inconclusive (nothing
consumed) => INCONCLUSIVE. The tally and any rejected entries are written to
`results/<target>/<label>/consumer_result`, the return code to `consumer_rc`,
both pulled out and gated on without parsing JSON.

Signal quality on a gcc-built target: meaningful, not noise-dominated. On the
pinned curl build all 20 sampled entries come back OK (`ok=20 fail=0
inconclusive=0`): clang-tidy consumes the gcc-recorded database cleanly, parses
every TU without error, and only the deliberate fault flips a verdict. The
build-dir-aware sampler (`--build-dir <BUILD_DIR>`) avoids generated-header-heavy
TUs, which keeps good entries from tripping the not-found FAIL.

Boundary to scrutinize (the OK<->FAIL line): because a not-found header is FAIL,
a future target whose sampled TUs legitimately depend on a generated header the
build CLEANS before this loop runs would false-FAIL. That does not happen for
curl/zlib (the build leaves its tree intact and the sampler prefers source-tree
TUs); it is the honest trade - keeping not-found as INCONCLUSIVE would have
masked the very wrong-`-I` defect the check is for. If such a target appears,
narrow the FAIL rule to "not-found header NOT reachable from a build-dir
include", rather than blanket-INCONCLUSIVE-ing not-found.

Image requirement: the base image installs `clang clang-tools-extra` in its final
stage (a CONSUMER tool, like `cdb-compare`, NOT a toolchain - so it goes in the
final stage, not the toolchain-only builder), with a `clang-tidy --version` sanity
in the final stage. Every per-target image layers on this base, so the check needs
no per-target change; `BUILD_DIR` from config.env (reused as the sampler's
`--build-dir`) is the only per-target input.

## dogfood-clang-consumer fault demonstration (Stage 6 exit criterion)

The exit criterion requires the check to catch a deliberately broken entry: a
stripped `-I` the tool then rejects. Unlike the replay bad-directory fault (a
host-side fixture in `selftest.sh`), this demo MUST run where clang exists - IN
the build container - because the host has no compiler. It is therefore a small,
clearly-labeled in-container one-off, `consumer-fault-demo.sh`, run by the
maintainer against the curl target image:

```sh
podman run --rm --systemd=always \
    -v tests/dogfooding/consumer-loop.sh:/consumer-loop.sh:ro,Z \
    -v tests/dogfooding/consumer-fault-demo.sh:/demo.sh:ro,Z \
    bear-dogfood-curl:<sha> sh /demo.sh
```

It builds curl (so the capture, sources, and headers exist), takes a KNOWN-GOOD
entry the consumer accepts (`altsvc.c` => OK), strips the `-I/src*` flags that
TU needs to find `curl/system.h`, and shows the SAME shipped `consumer_cdb`
function now reports FAIL for that entry. No JSON is hand-edited beyond removing
the one include group; the fault is a real, broken database entry. The demo
exits 0 iff the good entry was OK (rc 0) and the broken entry was caught (rc 1).
Observed: `good: rc=0 (ok=1 fail=0 inconclusive=0)`, `bad: rc=1 (ok=0 fail=1
inconclusive=0)`, diagnostic `error: 'curl/system.h' file not found`,
`DEMO PASSED`.

## dogfood-injected-fault demonstration (Stage 4 exit criterion)

The Stage 4 exit criterion requires the checks to demonstrably catch an injected
fault - a dropped entry, a duplicated entry, and a corrupted `directory`. This
is demonstrated WITHOUT a container by `selftest.sh` against tiny, committed,
hand-written fault fixtures under `faults/` (so the fault is unambiguous and not
the product of fragile in-shell JSON surgery on a real capture):

- `faults/duplicate.json` - two byte-identical entries => `cdb-compare
  invariants` FAILS its no-true-duplicates check.
- `faults/empty-arguments.json` - an entry with `"arguments": []` => invariants
  FAILS non-empty-arguments.
- `faults/undercount.json` - 2 entries asserted against `--expected-objects 3
  --tolerance 0` => invariants FAILS entry-count (the "dropped entry" fault).
- `faults/bad-directory.json` - a valid entry whose `directory` does not exist
  => the replay loop FAILS (the recorded compile can never run from where Bear
  claims it did - the "corrupted directory" fault). `faults/tu/hello.c` is the
  trivial TU it nominally compiles.

`selftest.sh` runs the host `cdb-compare invariants` against the invariants
fixtures and the SAME `replay-loop.sh` function (host-side) against the
bad-directory fixture, asserts each check exits non-zero (the fault was caught),
adds a control that an honest CDB passes (no false positive), and prints a clear
pass/fail. It needs no container and no `jq`, so it is fast and is the
demonstrable-fault-catching deliverable. It is invoked as
`tests/dogfooding/selftest.sh`.

## dogfood-metrics-collect (Stage 5)

While Bear builds a target, the suite can profile `bear-driver`'s CPU and memory
with rprof (github.com/rizsotto/rprof) and keep the full capture as an artifact.
The profiled subject is `bear-driver` SPECIFICALLY - the component that
accumulates every intercepted execution and serializes the compilation database,
so its memory is the load-bearing scaling signal; the short-lived per-exec
preload and `bear-wrapper` are not profiled.

This is intentionally NOT automated: the harness only COLLECTS the rprof JSONL -
it never parses or summarizes it. The maintainer runs `rprof view` afterward to
render and compare runs. (The in-run previous-release baseline and metrics-delta
from plan.md Stage 5 are deliberately deferred; this scope is just the rprof
capability.)

Implementation: rprof (pinned to its `v1.0.0` release) is baked into the base
image via the existing multi-stage build - compiled in the toolchain-carrying
builder, the ~1 MB static binary copied into the toolchain-free final on PATH.
The `--metrics` flag turns the build into `rprof run -o /out/metrics.jsonl --
bear -- <build>`. Because the `bear` entry script execs `bear-driver` (same PID)
and rprof measures the single launched process WITHOUT following descendants,
this profiles exactly `bear-driver` and excludes the build's compiler processes -
no PID gymnastics needed. The whole JSONL is copied to
`results/<target>/<label>/metrics.jsonl` (determinism's two builds yield
`metrics.run1.jsonl` / `metrics.run2.jsonl`).

`--metrics` is an additive modifier: it layers on any mode (golden / oracle /
determinism / invariants / replay), and on a gate-less (`VALIDATION=none`) target
with no check mode it stands alone as a profiled build whose deliverable is the
artifact. The metrics file is advisory - a missing file warns, never fails - and
the wrapping is runner-controlled (rprof in the base is harmless when unused).
